        <h5 id="heade5">My favourite hobby is reading books. I prefer reading fictional books, although i do also sometimes read non-fiction books and biographies. My favourite genre is Humour. I love reading humurous books like Diary of a wimpy kid, Percy Jackson, Trials of Apollo, diary of a minecraft zombie, etc. I also like horror novels. And, my dear friends, if you're looking for a horror book series, then there is nothing better i could recommend you better than goosebumps. They're so scary, so scary, that.....It's kinda unexplainable in words. Just read them, but be ready for the horrors! So, what's my favourite book series. There isn't one series. All the series of Rick Riordan, which are, I'm telling you orderly,Percy Jackson, Heroes of Olympus, Trials of Apollo, Kane Chronicles, Demigods and Magicians and Magnus Chase. These books have mystery, humour, sarcasm, adventure, combat and a lot of other genres all combined and spread equally. These books, they'll crack you up no matter how depressed you are. I still remember the day when i had broken a very expensive flower vase by mistake. My parents had scolded me a lot. I was very sad. That day i read my first Percy Jackson book after my parents scolded me. After one chapter, i was giggling like a madman. I used to get stomach-aches because of laughing every day after i started reading Rick Riordan's books. Now, it's only once a week. Given the Humour in the book, it's pretty less. If you wanna know more about the series, go on, read them. Adios, Amigos! </h5>
